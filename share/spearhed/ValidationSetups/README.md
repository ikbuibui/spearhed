# Sod Shock Tube Validation Setups

1D, 2D, and 3D Sod shock tube validation for SPEARHED. The two fluid states split
along x; transverse directions are symmetric slabs with frozen-wall boundaries.

All three dimensions share a single setup header (`SodShockTube.hpp`) and
dimension-specific param directories.

## Manual run

The following example builds and runs the 2D setup with the CPU OMP2 backend.
Run the first block from the repository root:

```bash
SPEARHED_ROOT="$PWD"
SOD_BUILD=path-to-spearhed-sod-2d-build
SOD_OUTPUT=path-to-spearhed-sod-2d-output

cmake -S "$SPEARHED_ROOT" -B "$SOD_BUILD" \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -Dalpaka_ACC_CPU_B_OMP2_T_SEQ_ENABLE=ON \
    -DSPEARHED_ENABLE_OPENPMD=ON \
    -DSPEARHED_SETUP_FILE="$SPEARHED_ROOT/share/spearhed/ValidationSetups/SodShockTube.hpp" \
    -DSPEARHED_PARAM_DIR="$SPEARHED_ROOT/share/spearhed/ValidationSetups/SodShockTube2D"

cmake --build "$SOD_BUILD" -j 4
mkdir -p "$SOD_OUTPUT"
```

Run from the output directory so the openPMD file and validation plot are kept
together:

```bash
cd "$SOD_OUTPUT"
"$SOD_BUILD/include/spearhed/spearhed" \
    -s 200 -d 1 --openPMD.period 200 --openPMD.file 'sod_%06T.h5'

python "$SPEARHED_ROOT/share/spearhed/ValidationSetups/SodShockTube/validate_sod.py" \
    . --step 200 --dt 0.001 --bins 200
```

This writes `sod_000200.h5` and `sod_validation.png` which can be viewed to analyse the validation.

To select another dimension, use the corresponding parameter directory and a
fresh build directory:

| Dimension | Parameter directory |
|---|---|
| 1D | `SodShockTube` |
| 2D | `SodShockTube2D` |
| 3D | `SodShockTube3D` |

The serial CPU backend can be selected with
`-Dalpaka_ACC_CPU_B_SEQ_T_SEQ_ENABLE=ON`, but OMP2 is substantially faster for
larger runs.

## Parameter table

| | 1D | 2D | 3D |
|---|---|---|---|
| **simDim** | DIM1 | DIM2 | DIM3 |
| **h0** | 0.05 | 0.02 | 0.08 |
| **dt** | 0.001 | 0.001 | 0.001 |
| **dxLeft** | 1.125/32000 ~ 3.5e-5 | 0.005 | 1/30 ~ 0.033 |
| **dxRight** | 8 x dxLeft | sqrt(8) x dxLeft ~ 0.0141 | 2 x dxLeft ~ 0.067 |
| **Ly (=Lz)** | -- | 0.07 | 1/3 |
| **Wall thickness W** | 2×h0 = 0.1 | 0.04 | 0.16 |
| **Fluid particles** | 28444+3555 | 2800+350 | 3000+375 |
| **Total incl. walls** | ~35k | ~7.0k | ~15k |
| **Wall pieces** | 2 (x-caps) | 6 | 10 |

## Pre-migration SC baseline

The spacing-driven layout was characterized before the domain- and
count-driven SC migration. The host-side regression test is
`tests/spmacc/unit/SCCharacterization/SCCharacterization.cpp`. It evaluates all
three dimensions independently of the configured simulation dimension.

The approximate target counts below are the resolution inputs to preserve
through the migration. The 1D legacy spacing produces one fewer particle than
its target because its left and right cell counts are independently truncated.

| Dimension | Migration target | Left cells | Right cells | Left particles | Right particles | Actual fluid particles | Particle mass |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1D | 32000 | `[28444]` | `[3555]` | 28444 | 3555 | 31999 | 3.515625e-5 |
| 2D | 3150 | `[200, 14]` | `[70, 5]` | 2800 | 350 | 3150 | 2.500000e-5 |
| 3D | 3375 | `[30, 10, 10]` | `[15, 5, 5]` | 3000 | 375 | 3375 | 3.7037044e-5 |

Effective spacing is the region extent divided by its integer cell count; it
can differ from the configured nominal spacing after rounding:

| Dimension | Left effective spacing | Right effective spacing |
|---|---|---|
| 1D | `[3.5156798e-5]` | `[2.8129396e-4]` |
| 2D | `[0.005, 0.005]` | `[0.014285714, 0.014]` |
| 3D | `[0.033333335, 0.033333335, 0.033333335]` | `[0.06666667, 0.06666667, 0.06666667]` |

### openPMD and validation baseline

These values were measured at source revision
`8b3829c7d4a6168f802e5ca9a2da50c8af95f2bb` with the Release OMP2 backend,
four OpenMP threads, `dt = 0.001`, 200 steps, and 200 x bins. The step-zero
openPMD files contained only the `fluid` species and confirmed the regional
counts and common masses in the table above. The fluid count was unchanged at
step 200.

| Dimension | Fluid particles in openPMD | Density L1 | Velocity x L1 | Pressure L1 | Internal energy L1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1D | 31999 | 0.0118 | 0.0281 | 0.0133 | 0.0510 |
| 2D | 3150 | 0.0371 | 0.0838 | 0.0416 | 0.0999 |
| 3D | 3375 | 0.0524 | 0.1002 | 0.0607 | 0.1173 |

The corresponding transverse diagnostics were:

| Dimension | max abs(v_y) | L1(v_y) | max abs(v_z) | L1(v_z) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2D | 2.376032 | 0.047952 | -- | -- |
| 3D | 0.775681 | 0.034993 | 0.789283 | 0.032477 |

These measurements characterize current behavior; they are not acceptance
thresholds. In particular, the large transverse maxima are retained here so a
migration does not silently appear to improve or regress pre-existing boundary
artifacts.

## Tuning knobs

- `dxLeft` -- controls particle resolution. Edit `spacingLeft()` in `SodShockTube.hpp`.
- `Ly`, `Lz` -- transverse extent. Edit `transverseExtent()`.
- `dt` is compile-time. Change `dt` in the selected `dimension.param` before
  configuring, or copy that parameter directory to a build-local location,
  edit the copy, and pass the copy as `SPEARHED_PARAM_DIR`. Pass exactly the
  same value to `validate_sod.py`.
- The simulation step count is the value passed to `spearhed -s`. Use the same
  value for `--openPMD.period` and the validator's `--step` so the requested
  snapshot exists. `--bins` only controls the validator's x binning.

## Validation reference

The 1D exact Riemann solution is the correct reference in 2D/3D -- the Sod
problem is a 1D Riemann problem; transverse directions are symmetric.
`validate_sod.py` projects onto x and bins there, averaging over transverse
directions.

Transverse-velocity symmetry diagnostics (`max|v_y|`, `L1(v_y)`, etc.) are
printed for 2D/3D snapshots to catch multi-D contamination.

## Expected L1 magnitudes (indicative, may drift with code changes)

| Field | Typical 1D L1 |
|---|---|
| density | ~0.02 |
| velocity x | ~0.03 |
| pressure | ~0.03 |
| internal energy | ~0.05 |

For 2D/3D, expect roughly comparable L1 values. Transverse velocities should
have `max|v_y,z|` < 0.01 for a converged run (small non-zero values near walls
are expected due to frozen-wall shear).

## Notes

- The 2D transverse extent is chosen so the left and right particle counts have
  the exact 8:1 ratio required by the equal-mass density jump.
- Right wall has ~2.4 particle layers in 3D (W = 2×h0 covers one support radius);
  if artifacts appear, increase h0 slightly.
- Frozen transverse walls keep their initial state; post-shock fluid sliding
  along them sees stale wall pressure -> small non-zero v_y/v_z near walls.
